        The SR-71 sas developed as a black projet fom the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's
        <br>
Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly” Johnson was responsible for many of the aircraft's
<br>
innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft tobe designed
<br>
‘with reduced radar cross-section. At one point, a bomber varinat of the aircraft was under consideration, before the program
<br>
‘was focused solely on reconnaissance, Mission equipment forthe ecoansissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a
<br>
side looking airborne radar, and a pote camera: the SR-71 was both longer aud heavier than the 12, allowing it hold more
<br>
fel as well asa two-seat cockpit, The SR-71 designation has been atuibuted to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff
<br>
General Cutis LeMay. who preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS (Reconnaissance). The
<br>
alrorafi was introduced to operational service in January 1966.
